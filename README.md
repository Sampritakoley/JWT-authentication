# JWT-authentication
[Project branch -dev]
Here, I have implemented the JWT Authentication Project for Spring Boot. This project demonstrates how to implement a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a Spring Boot application. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular way to implement stateless authentication in web applications. This project provides a simple yet comprehensive example of how to integrate JWT authentication into a Spring Boot application, including user registration, login, token-based security, and generated refresh token.

#Features

#User Registration: Create new user accounts with unique usernames and secure password hashing.

#User Authentication: Log in with a username and password to receive a JWT for authentication in future requests.

#Token-Based Security: Use JWTs to protect API endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.

#Role-Based Authorization: Restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles (e.g., user, admin).

#Automatic Token Refresh: Implement a mechanism to refresh JWTs as they expire, ensuring a seamless user experience.
